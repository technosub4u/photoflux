        The Service Provider may use the information you provide to contact you from time to time 
        with important information, required notices, and marketing promotions.
    </p>

    <p>
        For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you 
        to provide certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to email 
        address and user ID. This information will be retained and used as described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Third Party Access</h2>

    <p>
        Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to help the 
        Service Provider improve the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your 
        information with third parties as described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Application uses third-party services that have their own privacy policies regarding data handling:
